Software\nTREND: TRack Equilibrium or Non-equilibrium shifts in Data\nResolve Trends such as Binding Isotherms and Time Courses Directly from Spectra, Imaging, or Lists\nIntroduction:\nTREND is a package that determines the main trend(s) of change across a series of 2D digital measurements, such as imaging and NMR spectra. TREND works by applying principal component analysis to non-interpreted 2D digital measurements in multiple formats including NMR spectra, raw NMR data, images, movies, lists, and spreadsheet files. The principal components extracted from them by TREND represent the main changes among the data frames. These could be binding isotherms, time courses, or a variety of population shifts. The main requirement is that the data frames be measured consistently (with the same parameters) to support quantitative comparison. Series of 2D measurements in an unsupported format may be converted into a text file or spreadsheet in order to be read by TREND for analysis. TREND is written as a set of Python scripts. These were packaged using PyInstaller for ease of installation under Windows, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu and Fedora versions of Linux. TREND (sponsored by NSF) is free for academic users.\nTREND captures main time courses of change of movies or NMR spectra  \nTREND\nAcademic Software License RequestNon-Academic/Commerical Software License RequestTREND Academic Software License Agreement [PDF]  \n"},"doc/intro.html":{"url":"doc/intro.html","title":"A simple example","keywords":"","body":"Simple Example: Determine binding isotherm from NMR spectra in UCSF format\nGUI USAGE\n\nChoose nmr tab of trendmaingui and press browse button highlighted by the box.Choose a series of Sparky format spectra (.UCSF files) and TREND will \nsort them numerically.  \nSpecify required arguments including file format, method of scaling \nrows, the prefix of output files, threshold for smallest signals to be \nretained (x-fold the noise), whether to export CSV-format spreadsheet \nfiles, and whether to generate an HTML report.

Here we specify xaxis and xunits  \nPress start button, TREND will run for a while and finish.  \nAfter trendmain finishes, an HTML report is generated.

The simple \ninstallation process merely creates shortcuts on the desktop and helps \nset environment variables of for the text shell window that will make TREND \neasy to use. The installation script places on the Desktop a directory \ncontaining symbolic links to the executable files with GUI.\nThe OS X and Linux installation script change the PATH environment variable. \nThe Windows script TRENDterminal.bat opens a command shell in which all \nexecutable files of TREND (with suffix of .exe) can be invoked, both the \nversions operated by GUI and at the command line. \nNote that the installation process is not completed until the first \ncalculations using trendmain and trendreconstruct trigger the download \nand installation of two pieces of software from the public domain for \nhandling movies and images. This download requires both a reliable internet \nconnection and access to github. If this access is lacking upon initial \nusage, please see the document no_internet_connection.pdf\nWindows 7 or above\n\nUnzip the TREND-Win7-version.7z by 7zip.  \nIn the unzipped folder, double clicking install.bat will create a file\nnamed TRENDterminal and a folder on the desktop and start menu named \nTREND-GUI containing trendmaingui.exe, trendplotgui.exe, and \ntrendreconstructgui.exe. Refresh the desktop by right-clicking in an \nopen area and select Refresh.  \nInvoke any of these GUI versions of the executable files by double-clicking\non them within the TREND-GUI folder. If TREND was previously installed, \nthe old version will be uninstalled before new version is installed.   \nAn alternative way to run either the GUI or command-line versions of the\nexecutable files involves first double clicking on TRENDterminal.bat.\nThis will open a Windows command shell in which you can cd to your data \nfolder and invoke the TREND executable files. This does not change your \npath environment permanently and should be run every time you need a \ncommand shell window for TREND.  \nNote the .7z tarball can be deleted but the unzipped folder should not\nbe removed or deleted, since the installation step just creates shortcuts.  \n\nMac OS X 10.7.5 and later\n\nUnzip the TREND-OSX-Lion-version.tar.gz by double clicking the file \ndisplayed in the OS X GUI. Alternatively, run the command \ntar -xzvf TREND-OSX.tar.gz within a terminal shell.  \nOpen a terminal shell and cd to the unzipped folder named \nTREND-version-OSX, enter the command ./install.script to create a \nTREND-GUI folder on the desktop, which contains trendmaingui.app, \ntrendplotgui.app, and trendreconstructgui.app. \nThe installation scripts can only be executed within the terminal shell.\n(Do not run this script directly from OS X desktop GUI by clicking \nbecause the installation script will not work properly).  \nThree icons, trendmaingui.app, trendplotgui.app, and trendreconstructgui.app\nwill also be added to /Applications/TREND. These icons should be visible \nin Launchpad and the Applications folder in Finder. (Refreshing Launchpad \nmay be needed).  \nThe current TREND directory is also added to the PATH environment \nvariable. Three lines will be added to the file ~/.bash_profile. The \nlines begin with #TREND path environment  \nOpen a new terminal or type and enter the command source ~/.bash_profile \nwithin a terminal shell. Now all TREND commands can be launched in a terminal.  \nIf TREND was previously installed,  the old version will be uninstalled \nbefore the new installation.  \nsudo may be necessary if permission is required.An example: Download TREND-OSX-Lion-version.tar.gz to ~/Downloads/  \nIf you are comfortable with shell terminal, you can just enter \n./change_path_env.script to add the current TREND directory to PATH \nenvironment variable. No permission is required.  tar -xzvf TREND-OSX-Lion-version.tar.gz\ncd ~/Downloads/TREND-OSX-10.7.5\n./install.script \n(or sudo ./install.script if permission is required)\n\n\n\nLinux 64-bit, such as recent Ubuntu 14.04, Fedora 23 and later\n\nUnzip the TREND-Ubuntu14.04-version.tar.gz by entering the command \ntar -xzvf TREND-Ubuntu14.04-version.tar.gz within a terminal shell.  \nEnter ./install.script within the terminal shell to add the current \nTREND directory to the PATH environment variable. Three lines will be \nadded to ~/.bashrc, starting with #TREND path environment.   \nOpen a new terminal or type source ~/.bashrc. Now all TREND commands\ncan be launched in terminal.  \nInstallation in Linux is similar to OS X, as the install.script is \nwritten for bash, a shell that is the default in Mac OS X and many Linux \ndistributions. However, a Linux computer may run without a desktop and may\nuse a shell other than bash. In this case, you need to set the path \nenvironment variables yourself. e.g., modifying a shell configuration \nfile such as .bashrc, .cshrc, .tcshrc....  \nUninstalling or Moving\n\nRun uninstall.bat in Windows or uninstall.script in OS X and Linux.    \n\nThen delete the TREND-Win7-version ,TREND-OSX-10.7.5, or \nTREND-Ubuntu14.04-version folder.  \nTo move the TREND folder to a new location, first uninstall it, move \nthe TREND foler to the new location, and install it again, thereby \noverwriting the previously installed TREND executable files.  \n\n"},"doc/manual/GUI.html":{"url":"doc/manual/GUI.html","title":"Graphic User Interface","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to Graphic User Interface of TREND\nDescription:\nBoth GUI and command-line versions of TREND are available. The arguments \nand usages of GUI panels are briefly introduced below. Detailed explainations \nof choices of arguments and parameters are provided in the manual for \ncommand-line versions.  \nMain Script - Obtain Principal Components from a series of 2D Measurements\n\nLaunch using trendmaingui.exe or trendmaingui.app. In the  left side \nbar, there are for different modes to choose from: basic, all_purpose, \nnmr, and movie. They function similarly with minor differences.   \nThe basic menu can be used for simple PCA work. A series of 2D data \nfiles (or an index file listing the series of data files) can be read by \nthe file File Chooser widget. Note the file File Chooser can do two \nthings:  If input file names contains numbers, TREND can extract numbers \nfrom the file names and sort these names numerically. A corresponding \nfile index (file.index) will be generated automatically. Or you can \nmake a file index manually with a text editor according to the format \ndescribed in the manual.File format, scaling methods (on row), prefix of output file names can \nalso be specified. The lower half of the panel shows optional arguments \nwhich can be left blnak. A file list the tick marks for the x-axis can be \nselected by the xaixs File Chooser. The units of the x axis can be also \nspecified and will take effect if a file is selected in xaxis. When the \ncsv checkbox is turned on, the PCA  results will be exported in \ncomma-separated values (CSV) format that can be read by spreadsheets such \nas Excel or OpenOffice. The  report checkbox is on by default. This \ngenerates an HTML report of arguments used by main script, links to files \ngenerated by PCA (PC values, normalized PC1, other files for plots, the \nS matrix, etc), and illustrations of the scree plot, normalized PC1, \nfirst 3 PCs, and autocorrelation coefficents.   \nThe all_purpose menu provides additional options. When the reconst \notpion is turned on, temporary files are saved for later use in \nreconstruction of the data from the components specified.  Scaling of \ncolumns can be specified, but should not be necessary if the rows are \nscaled. If the input file type is Fourier-Transformed NMR spectrum \n(NMRPipe ft2 format or Sparky UCSF format), the spectra can be \n\"binned\" for compression or uniformity. The bintimes parameter for this \ncan be speicified.Detail descriptions can be found in the manual. In the all_purpose menu,ICA (independent component analysis) can be selected instead of PCA. When \nICA is chosen, the number of independent components to be calculated \nshould be specified (Xu and Van Doren, submitted).   \nThe nmr mode is for analysis of NMR spectra. It is similar to the \nall_purpose menu but only offers selection of data in these formats: \nNmrPipe fid and ft2, Sparky ucsf and sparky peak list \n(sparkylist). \nBruker Topspin FID and spectra as brukerfid and brukerspectra. \nAgilent (Varian) VnmrJ FID and spectra as agilentfid and \nagilentspectra. Different from other formats which data are saved as \nfiles, the Topspin and VnmrJ formats are saved as directories. Therefore \na dir Directory Chooser widget is provided for the Topspin and VnmrJ \ndata directories. Its usage is similar to the file File Chooser widget \ndescribed previously. Besides, a manually made directory index, which is \nin the same form of file.index can still be read by the file File \nChooser for parsing Topspin and VnmrJ directories. See manual for details. \nThe default scaling method of rows of the data matrix is auto, which \nis recommended for series of NMR spectra in fast or slow exchange \nregimes. pareto is recommended for spectra with intermdiate exchange. \nnoscaling should be acceptable for all exchange regimes. Details of \nchoosing scaling method and setting the threshold to filter out noise are \ngiven in the manual and Jia Xu and Steven R. Van Doren, Binding Isotherms \nand Time Courses Readily from Magnetic Resonance. Anal. Chem. 2016, 88 \n(16), pp 8172-8178threshold and thresholdnumber can be set for filtering noise out of \nNMR spectra. The three ways to set the threshold are auto, absolute, \nand the number of times the noise level. In auto mode, the program \ndetermines noise from the first spectrum and sets the threshold as 4-fold \nthe noise level for autoscaling and 0.5 times the noise level for \nPareto scaling.   \nThe movie menu is for processing movies or time-dependent PNG image \nseries. The recommended scaling method of rows is noscaling. A file \nlisting tick marks for the x-axis can be specified. When processing a \nmovie, time will be automatically extracted from the movie and saved as \nmovie_time.txt for use as x-axis. The movie (but not series of PNG \nimages) can be resized to make it smaller by skipping frames of the movie \nand setting the parameters compress and sparsity according to the \nmanual. TREND can clip a movie by setting starttime and endtime \nparameters. The number format for setting start and end time could either \nbe floating point numbers of seconds (e.g. 0.2), or hh:mm:ss.ff, such as \n00:03:05.00. The default values for the starttime and endtime are \n0.0 and end, which do not clip the movie.  Plotting script -- display the principal components identified by the main script\n\nThe program for plotting with GUI is trendplotgui.exe in Windows and \nLinux, or trendplotgui.app ini OS X. The report option of the main \nscript generates an HTML report including several figures including the \nfirst 3 PCs and scree plot, trendplotgui non-essential for visualizaing \nresults. However, trendplotgui.exe provides more control of plotting, \nsuch as choices of kinds of normalization and single components to plot.  \nThere are two modes trendplotgui: PCA and ICA.. It is critical to select \nthe appropriate mode.   \npca mode: The Vt matrix and S matrix are needed for plotting PCA results. \nThese matrices can be selected using the vtmatrix and smatrix file \nchoosers. However, there is an easier way: Setting readparm to Yes \nwill read the arguments that trendmain used and automatically locate \nthe matrices as well as the choices of xaxis and xunit. pcn sets \nthe first N PCs to be plotted. When the single checkbox is turned on, \npcn just plot the Nth PC. The type of normalization can be selected by \nsetting normalmode according to Table 1 of the manual.   \nica mode is very similar to pca mode, but does not read smatrix \nor show a scree plot.  \n\ntrendreconstruct - Use the PCA calculations to reconstruct features\nin the sereis of 2D measurementstrendreconstructgui.exe in Windows and Linux or trendreconstruct.app \nin OS X is the program with GUI that uses the results from trendmaingui.exe \nto reconstruct single or multiple PC representations of the original \nseries of 2D measurements. It is quite self-explanatory. The manual \nprovides more details.trendreconstructgui reads  parameters and results from trendmain or \ntrendmaingui. A PCA calculation must be carried out by trendmain with \nreconstruction option turned on. When performing reconstructions of a \nPNG image series, choosing to export original format will actually\n generate an mp4 movie clip. Choosing the PNG option instead plots \n reconstructed images. \n"},"doc/manual/manual.html":{"url":"doc/manual/manual.html","title":"Command Line Interface","keywords":"","body":"Main Script - Obtain Principal Components from a series of 2D Measurements\n\nBoth GUI (Graphic User Interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface) programs\nGUI: trendmaingui.exe in Windows and Linux, trendmaingui.app in OS X\nCLI: trendmain.exe on all platforms\n\nSynopsis\ntrendmain.exe -t [ucsf/fid/ft2/png/movie/txt/sparky/csv/excel/…] -f [file index]\n-r [threshold] -o [output prefix name] -s [scaling methods] [-x [xaxis file]] [-u [Unit]]\n[--report]\n\nDescription\ntrendmain.exe reads a series of NMR spectra, FIDs, png images, the \nJoint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical data - Data eXchange \n(JCAMP-DX) format, plain text files, comma-separated (CSV) or Excel \nspreadsheets listed in the index file.\ntrendmain.exe also reads and process single file, including movie, CSV or \nExcel spreadsheet, or text file.

Otherwise the phasefile will be all zero values. See \nthe Sparky manual \nfor details.Note TREND supports on-the-fly analysis on Bruker and \nAgilent spectrometers. However to avoid effect of non-uniformity \nor outliers, all experimetnal data analyzed by TREND are preferably \nto be collected and processed in identical conditions. Therefore, \nwe highly recommend using the same set of NMRPipe scripts to \nconvert Bruker or Agilent data into NMRPipe fid and ft2 formats.  \ntxt Data stored in plain text format delimited by spaces, this \noption could be used for other spectroscopy methods such as time-\ndependent 2D-IR.  \ncsv  csv format is supported by Excel, OpenOffice and many \nsoftware for spectroscopy instruments.  \ncomplextxt Similar to plain text format (txt) but using complex\nnumber in the form of 0.00+0.00j.  \ncomplexcsv  Similar to csv format. However, each cell should be in\nthe format of 0.00+0.00j.  \nexcel Microsoft Excel format (xlsx is preferred, the older xls\nformat is also accepted). All cells must be float or complex numbers. \nThe complex number should be in the form of 0.00+0.00j. By default an\nExcel file contains three sheets, only the first sheet is analyzed. \nExcel with multi-sheets can be processed as singleexcel option.    \nsparky or sparkylist Sparky list format. The 1st column lists any residue \nassignments. The 2nd and 3rd columns are F1 (often 15N) and F2 (often \n1H) chemical shifts, respectively.  \nsinglematrix This mode serves as a general PCA tool to process a \nsingle matrix in the text format delimited with spaces.   \nsinglecsv  Similar to singlematrix format but in csv format\nsingleexcel  Similar to singlematrix and singlecsv formats but\nin the xlsx or xls formats. Besides, a series of 1D or 2D dataset \ncan be stored in a single Excel file containing different, \nsequentially-ordered sheets.  \nmovie Common video formats, such as .ogv, .mp4, .mpeg, \n.avi, .mov, .webm   \njcamp JCAMP-DX is a general format for exchanging and archiving \ndata from many instruments, including but not limited to IR, Raman, \nUv-Vis, Fluorescence, NMR, and EMR. The data stored in JCAMP-DX \nfiles can be spectral plots, contours, or peak tables.  JCAMP-DX \nis very flexible in order to support most kinds of computerized \ninstruments. As a result, it is impractical to support all \nexisting JCAMP-DX variants. However, TREND supports most common \nJCAMP-DX formats. The digital data in JCAMP-DX can be AFFN \n(ASCII FREE FORMAT NUMERIC) form or ASDF (ASCII SQUEEZED \nDIFFERENCE FORM). TREND supports decoding compressed data, \nincluding PAC, SQZ, DIF, SQZDUP, and DIFDUP. Two most \ncommon tabular data form, (X++(Y..Y)) and (XY..XY) are supported. \nTREND reads a series of JCAMP-DX files, or a single JCAMP-DX file \nwith one or multiple blocks. TREND supports NTUPLE format \n(introduced by JCAMP-DX 5.0 standard), which is designed for \nmulti-dimensional techniques with data sets of multiple variable. \nFor example, JCAMP-DX NMR uses NUTPLE to show mixed real/imaginary \nFID data sets. See http://www.jcamp-dx.org/ , \nhttps://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/formats/jcamp_dx/\nand http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm:1104/spectra/testdata/index.html \nfor details of JCAMP-DX formats.   \n\n\n-f [fileindex/filename]\n-f reads file index and is required\n\n[fileindex] is a text format index referring to the  series of NMR \nspectra, images, lists, or directories (for Bruker Topspin and \nAgilent VnmrJ data). The default file index name is file.index.\nAn example is a series of five .ucsf files named numerically. The index\nfile can be named as index.ucsf and includes the following lines in \nthe example:![file.index.png]\n(https://bitbucket.org/repo/bboE8M/images/1070799385-file.index.png)Another example is a series of Bruker Topspin directories on a \nWindows platform. Absolute paths are supported as well as relative \npath, which is shown in the UCSF example. This \"directory list\" \ncan be used for both brukerfid and brukerspectra. For \nbrukerfid data, TREND will read fid or ser data from the \nlisted directories. For brukerspectra data, TREND will read \n1r or 2rr files from the pdata1 subdirectorires. Therefore, \nthe processing number must always be set as 1.file.index for Agilent VnmrJ could be used in a simmilar manner, \nexcept its spectra are saved in the datdir subdirectories.   \n[filename] can be the name of a singlematrix data set or a movie file \nfor processing.  \n\n\n-s [none/noscaling/auto/pareto/]\n  -s specifies scaling method applied on rows of the data matrix.\n\nnone means skip centering and scaling of the rows of the data \nmatrix.  \nnoscaling means do data centering without scaling. It should \nbe accetable in most conditions.  \nauto means Autoscaling. It treats all peaks or features as equally\nimportant but inflates the measurement errors. It is recommended for NMR\nspectra in fast and slow exchange regimes.  \npareto means Pareto scaling. It reduces the importance of large \npeaks but enhances the low, broader peaks. It is recommended for NMR \nspectra in intermediate exchange.  \nDefinitions of the scaling methods are given in: J. BMC Genomics 2006, \n7, 142. Other scaling options mentioned in this paper, such as __vast__\nscaling, range scaling, level scaling are also provided.  \n\n\n-r [auto/1e5/3T/5t]\n-r sets the threshold for filtering low intensity regions. The threshold \nis meaningful when processing  2D NMR spectra (ucsf, ft2), but not for FIDs\nor images in png format. There are three ways to set the threshold: auto, \nabsolute, and manual (set the number of times the noise level).\n\nauto In auto mode the program determines noise from the first \nspectrum and set threshold as 4 times of the noise level for autoscaling\nand 0.5 times the noise level for Pareto scaling.  \n1e5: When the arguments are set as integral numbers or floating point\nnumbers , such as 1e5 or 100000. This is used to specify the \nthreshold value using the numbering scale of the measurement.  \n3T or 5t: Numbers with suffix T or t annotates  times of \nnoise level of the first spectrum. In this mode threshold is set as 3 or\n5 times of noise level of the first spectrum. Three to seven-fold (3T to \n7T) is the recommended range for NMR spectra.  \n\n\n-o [output prefix name]\n-o specifies the prefix of output files prefix-s.txt, prefix-vt.txt, \nprefix-pc.txt, and prefix-PC1.txt from PCA. prefix-pc.txt reports all\nprinciple components as successive vertical columns. prefix-PC1.txt \nreports the first principal component as a single vertical column, which in\na titration is the binding isotherm.\nFor example, the option -o test generates output files named as \ntest-s.txt, test-vt.txt, test-PC.txt, test-PC1.txt\nprefix-s.txt and prefix-vt.txt save S and VT matrices in the SVD \ncalculation. U matrix is by default omitted because its usually big size.\nWhen ICA is used instead of PCA (-i option is on), the prefix includes \nprefix-vt.txt, which is unmixing matrix, and prefix-IC.txt, which reports\nnormalized independent components as successive vertical columns.\n\n--csv \nWhen --csv is turned on, data in prefix-s.txt, prefix-pc.txt, \nprefix-PC1.txt, or prefix-IC.txt are generated as CSV files, which can \nbe read by software such as Excel or OpenOffice. The corresponding file \nnames are prefix-s.csv, prefix-pc.csv, prefix-PC1.csv, prefix-IC.csv.\nIn csv files (except prefix-s.csv), data is organized as sucessive \nvertical columns, where the first column represents component number. A \ntable header is added, such as # Component, PC1, PC2, PC3 ....  \n\n-bTraditional uniform binning is applied for NMR data when -b option is \nturned on, it does not improve accuracy but may be useful when the input \ndataset is too large. By default -b option is off. bintimes option \nneeds to be set in this condition.  \n--bintimes [binning time]Number of points to be integrated and merged together into a single point. \nThe default is 8. For example, if the size of a 2D spectra is 1024*2048, \nsetting --bintimes 8 causes size of binned spectra to become \n1024/8  2048/8 = 128  256  \n--compress [compress factor]When processing movie the video can be resized by [compress factor] to \nreduce computational cost. For example, 0.8 means the video size\nwill be resized to 80%. [compress factor] can be cho  sen from the interval \n(0, 1.0]. By default [compress factor] is set as 1.0, which means use all \nthe data, i.e. don't compress the data.\n--sparsity [sparsity factor]This option controls skipping frames of the input video file by picking up \nevery n-th frame from the video, where n is specified by [sparsity factor].\nFor example, a [sparsity factor] of 1 means all frames will be used. 2 uses \nevery second frame, 3 uses every third frame, and so on.  \n--starttime [start time]TREND supports making a subclip of input movie by setting start and end time. \nThe default value for --starttime is 0.0. The number format for setting \nstart and end time could either be floating point numbers of seconds \n(e.g. 0.2 stands for 0.2 s), or hh:mm:ss.ff, such as 00:03:05.00, \nwhich means 3 minutes and 5 seconds.  \n--endtime [end time]This option sets the end time for the subclip of input movie. By default \nit is set as end. When --starttime and --endtime are set as default, \n(0.0 and end, respectively), the whole input video will be analyzed. \nOtherwise a subclip video will be analyzed and exported as from-starttime-to-endtime_movieclip.mp4, \nor from-starttime_movieclip.mp4 if the --endtime is set as the default end.  \n--columnscaling [none/noscaling/auto/pareto]--columnscaling specifies the scaling method applied on columns of the \ndata matrix. Options and meanings of scaling methods are defined in the -s\noption. By default --columnscaling is set as [none].  \n-i or --icaThis option uses the independent component analysis (ICA) module instead of\nPCA.  \n--nicaWhen ICA is used, the number (n) of components to be calculated must be set\nas --nica n. The default n is 2.  \n--reconst--reconst is an option for reconstruction. It has no effect on the \ncalculation, but dumps necessary files for reconstruction in the future  \n--keepfiltered is an option for 2D NMR spectra reconstruction when \n--reconst is on. When the input files are 2D NMR data such as ucsf or ft2,\na threshold can be set using the -r option. All data points below the \nthreshold are filtered out. --keepfiltered dumps the filtered data points\nto a file for reconstruction purpose. This file is not required because \nreconstruction of PCA can be done without the filtered data points.  \n-x [xaxisfile]-x specifies the name of file containing the list of tick marks to be used\nfor the x-axis. It is optional. By default this option is off and x-axis \nticks are integers. When xaxisfile is specified, numbers within it will \nform the x-axis. The number of rows in xaxisfile should identical to \nindex file specified by the  -f [fileindex] option of trendmain.exeFor example, concentration.txt lists the five concentrations of a \ntitration, one per line:\n-u [Unit]-u specifies label placed on the X-axis for plotting. [Unit] can be any \nstring.  \n--report--report generates an HTML file named as prefix-report.html that reports\nthe results. The report lists arguments used for calculation and files \ncreated. It plots the first 3 PCs or ICs without normalization. It \nalso plots scree plot as well as autocorrelation coefficences that \nrepresent the smoothness of component curves. For more control of \nplotting of principal or independent components display, please use\ntrendplot.exe.  \n\n\n\nPlotting script -- display the principal components identified by the main script\n\nGUI and CLI programs\nGUI: trendplotgui.exe in Windows and Linux, trendplotgui.app in OS X\nCLI: trendplot.exe in all platforms\n\nSynopsis\ntrendplot.exe [-r] [-f] [prefix] [-x [xaxisfile]] [-u [Unit]] [-n [the first N components]]\n[-p] [-e] -m [0/1/2/3/4/5]] --plot\n\nDescription\ntrendplot.exe plots the output of trendmain.exe.

Therefore when -r is used\nall trendplot.exe options related to trendmain.exe program, such as -f \nand --ica options can be omitted.  \n-f [input prefix name]-f specifies prefix of input files. This needs to be the same as specified \nwith the -o option when using the trendmain.exe program. e.g. uM or time (min)\n-x [xaxisfile]The usage is identical to the -x option of trendmain.exe.  \n-u [Unit]The usage is identical to the -u option of trendmain.exe.  \n-n [integral number N]-n specifies the number of principal components to plot. For example, \n-n 3 plots the first 3 principal components.  \n--single--single plots the component number N specified by -n option. For \nexample, -n 3 --single plots the third principal component only.  \n-p-p plots PC1 values with normalization. This is normally the most \nimportant trend of change in an experiment. It is used without argument.  \n-e-e plots the scree plot, i.e. the size of each of the principal components   \n-m [0/1/2/3/4/5]\n-m  turns on normalization of the N principle components plotted using \nthe -n option.

For example, -n 1 means reconstruct the 2D \nmeasurements using only the first component, while -n 3 uses the \nthird components. To reconstruct individual, non-consecutive components, \nyou can separate the page numbers with commas: e.g. -n 2,4,6 would \nreconstruct using the second, fourth, and sixth components. To reconstruct \nthe range of components 1 to 3, use -n 1-3. Range and individual \ncomponents can be selected together, e.g. -n 1,3-5,7 means reconstruction \nby components 1, 3, 4, 5, 7. Note space is not allowed between selected \ncomponents unless quotation marks are used. i.e. -n '1, 3-5, 7'.   \n-m [1/2/3/4]\nBackground:  trendmain.exe reorganizes the measurements listed in \nfile.index as a large 2D matrix, filters them, and scales them for PCA. \nThe -m option specifies which stage of the process should be reconstructed. \n-m specifies which matrix will be reconstructed. The choices are:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatrix mode\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\n1\nThis recovers the state right before doing PCA. The large 2D matrix is row (column) scaled, with unchanged rows and noisy regions filtered out\n\n\n2\nThis differs from matrix mode 1 in that the rows (columns) are unscaled\n\n\n3\nThis option also recovers the filtered, unchanged rows from matrix mode 2\n\n\n4*\nThis option differs from matrix mode 3 in also recovering the low intensity regions filtered out from being below the threshold\n\n\n\n* mode 4 is for Fourier-Transformed 2D NMR spectra where -r option \n    was used in trendmain.exe to set the threshold for filtering low intensity\n    regions.\n\n-e\n-e is optional. When it is on, the reconstructions of the measurements are\nexported in the same format as the original measurements read into \ntrendmain.exe. If input format is movie or png, the output \nformat will be mp4 format movie clip. mp4 movie reconstructed from movie \nshares the same time length as the input movie. mp4 movie reconstructed \nfrom a series of PNG images is set as 10 second long.\n\n-p\n-p is optional. When it is on, the reconstructed images are exported as \nimages in PNG format.\n\n--gif--gif is optional. When it is on, the reconstructed movies are \nexported as GIF animation just in case there is no appropriate \nmedia player to play .mp4 movie clip generated by -e. GIF animation \nis more compatible since most web browsers can play it, although it \nhas larger size than mp4.  \n\n--dpiWhen -p option is turned on, --dpi specifies the dots-per-inch resolution\nof the png files to be reconstructed. By default, this is set to 96. This \noption is not required.  \n-z-z option is used to recover rows that do not change and hence was filtered\nout before doing PCA.  \n-r-r is used only when reconstructing 2D Fourier-transformed NMR spectra. \nWhen doing PCA on 2D NMR spectra, a threshold can be set to filter out noisy\nregions using the -r option for trendmain.exe. The -r option can be \nused in reconstruction to recover those noisy regions in order to fully \nrecover the original spectra. It is not required and is usually not necessary.  \n-d or --diff-d turns on the diff mode, exporting difference spectra instead of \nreconstructed spectra. It is used to visualize the difference between original\nand reconstructed spectra.  \n--rmsd--rmsd calculates the RMSD between the reconstructed and original data for\nall principal components. A file with suffix name as -rmsd.txt and prefix\nname specified by the -o option of trendmain.exe will be stored. For \nexample, if trendmain.exe was used with the -o example option, --rmsd \noption generates a file named as prefix-rmsd.txt.  \n-o [output prefix name]-o specifies the prefix of reconstructed files or images  \n\nSVD test script\n\nCLI program\ntrendtest.exe in all platforms\n\nSynopsis\ntrendtest.exe [-r] [-f [outname prefix of trendmain.exe]]\n\nDescription\ntrendtest.exe analyzes PCA results generated by trendmain.exe and reconst.py.\nIt saves a table of attributes for evaluating the SVD outcome in the \nprefix-svdtest.csv file. Columns of the table are: Component, Size of singular\nvalue, cumulative contribution ratio, auto correlation coefficient, RMSD, and \nNormalized RMSD, respectively. The last two columns are optional and depend on \nwhether trendreconstruct.exe --rmsd was executed.\n\nOptions\n\n-r-r reads all arguments used by trendmain.exe. When -r is used -f is \nnot necessary  \n-f [input prefix name]-f specifies the prefix of input files. This needs to be the same as specified \nwith the -o option when using the trendmain.exe program  \n\n\n\nReport script\n\nCLI program\ntrendplot.exe in all platforms.\n\nSynopsis\ntrendreport.exe\n\nDescription\ntrendreport.exe generates an HTML report just in case the trendmain \nwas executed without turning on --report option.\n\n\n"},"doc/tutorial/tutorial.html":{"url":"doc/tutorial/tutorial.html","title":"Extract the time courses of respiration and heart contraction","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial: Extract the time courses of respiration and heart contraction\n(The MRI movie is courtesy of Jens Frahm and coworkers at Max-Planck-Institut f�r\nBiophysikalische Chemie in G�ttingen and is available at:\nhttp://www.biomednmr.mpg.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=132&Itemid=38#Cardio  \n1.
