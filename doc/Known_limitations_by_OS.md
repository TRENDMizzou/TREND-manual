# Known limitations by operating system

## Fedora 23
- `trendmain` and `trendreport` are not able to launch web browser to 
open `-report.html` automatically

## OS X 10.7 to 10.8
- `GIF movie` option of `trendreconstruct` is not supported

## OS X 10.11
- The strict safety precautions of El Capitan prevent double clicking or 
use of the open command in terminal from launching TREND apps. The TREND 
apps may nonetheless be launched in a terminal (text) window. To enable 
opening of the apps by double clicking, enter the system preferences menu 
and go to Security & Privacy and select Allow app downloaded from anywhere, 
at least temporarily until you have run each of the apps.
